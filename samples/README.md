# Sample SensNode Applications

This directory contains a set of self contained samples used to exercise
various parts of the SensNode library. To use them simply extract the firmware
distribution archive to a directory of your choice and copy your chosen sample
CPP source file into the same directory.

You can then adjust the Makefile to select your target board and build and
deploy the application as follows:

```
make
make flash
```
